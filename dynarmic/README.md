Dynarmic
========

[![Github Actions Build Status (x86-64)](https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/dynarmic/actions/workflows/x86-64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/dynarmic/actions/workflows/x86-64.yml) [![Github Actions Build Status (AArch64)](https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/dynarmic/actions/workflows/aarch64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yuzu-mirror/dynarmic/actions/workflows/AArch64.yml)

A dynamic recompiler for ARM.

Highlight features:

- Fast dynamic binary translation via Just-in-Time compilation
- Clean API
- Implemented in modern C++20
- Hooks exposed for easy code instrumentation
- Code injection support for very fine-grained instrumentation
- Support for unusual address space setups (bring-your-own memory system)
- Native support for most popular operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Android)

*Please note that an adversarial guest program [can determine if it is being run under dynarmic](#disadvantages-of-dynarmic). Preventing this is not a goal of this project.*

### Supported guest architectures

* v3
* v4
* v4T
* v5TE
* v6K
* v6T2
* v7A
* 32-bit v8
* 64-bit v8

You can specify the specific guest version using [ArchVersion](src/dynarmic/interface/A32/arch_version.h).

There are no plans to support v1 or v2.

### Supported host architectures

* x86-64
* AArch64

There are no plans to support any 32-bit architecture.

Important API Changes in v6.x Series
------------------------------------

* **v6.7.0**
  * To support use cases where one wants to have the guest to have the same address space as the host, `nullptr` is now a valid value for `fastmem_pointer`.
    **This change is not backwards-compatible.** If you were previously using `nullptr` to represent an invalid fastmem arena, you will now have to use `std::nullopt`.


Documentation
-------------

Design documentation can be found at [docs/Design.md](docs/Design.md).


Usage Example
-------------

The below is a minimal example. Bring-your-own memory system.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>
#include <exception>

#include "dynarmic/interface/A32/a32.h"
#include "dynarmic/interface/A32/config.h"

using u8 = std::uint8_t;
using u16 = std::uint16_t;
using u32 = std::uint32_t;
using u64 = std::uint64_t;

class MyEnvironment final : public Dynarmic::A32::UserCallbacks {
public:
    u64 ticks_left = 0;
    std::array<u8, 2048> memory{};

    u8 MemoryRead8(u32 vaddr) override {
        if (vaddr >= memory.size()) {
            return 0;
        }
        return memory[vaddr];
    }

    u16 MemoryRead16(u32 vaddr) override {
        return u16(MemoryRead8(vaddr)) | u16(MemoryRead8(vaddr + 1)) << 8;
    }

    u32 MemoryRead32(u32 vaddr) override {
        return u32(MemoryRead16(vaddr)) | u32(MemoryRead16(vaddr + 2)) << 16;
    }

    u64 MemoryRead64(u32 vaddr) override {
        return u64(MemoryRead32(vaddr)) | u64(MemoryRead32(vaddr + 4)) << 32;
    }

    void MemoryWrite8(u32 vaddr, u8 value) override {
        if (vaddr >= memory.size()) {
            return;
        }
        memory[vaddr] = value;
    }

    void MemoryWrite16(u32 vaddr, u16 value) override {
        MemoryWrite8(vaddr, u8(value));
        MemoryWrite8(vaddr + 1, u8(value >> 8));
    }

    void MemoryWrite32(u32 vaddr, u32 value) override {
        MemoryWrite16(vaddr, u16(value));
        MemoryWrite16(vaddr + 2, u16(value >> 16));
    }

    void MemoryWrite64(u32 vaddr, u64 value) override {
        MemoryWrite32(vaddr, u32(value));
        MemoryWrite32(vaddr + 4, u32(value >> 32));
    }

    void InterpreterFallback(u32 pc, size_t num_instructions) override {
        // This is never called in practice.
        std::terminate();
    }

    void CallSVC(u32 swi) override {
        // Do something.
    }

    void ExceptionRaised(u32 pc, Dynarmic::A32::Exception exception) override {
        // Do something.
    }

    void AddTicks(u64 ticks) override {
        if (ticks > ticks_left) {
            ticks_left = 0;
            return;
        }
        ticks_left -= ticks;
    }

    u64 GetTicksRemaining() override {
        return ticks_left;
    }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MyEnvironment env;
    Dynarmic::A32::UserConfig user_config;
    user_config.callbacks = &env;
    Dynarmic::A32::Jit cpu{user_config};

    // Execute at least 1 instruction.
    // (Note: More than one instruction may be executed.)
    env.ticks_left = 1;

    // Write some code to memory.
    env.MemoryWrite16(0, 0x0088); // lsls r0, r1, #2
    env.MemoryWrite16(2, 0xE7FE); // b +#0 (infinite loop)

    // Setup registers.
    cpu.Regs()[0] = 1;
    cpu.Regs()[1] = 2;
    cpu.Regs()[15] = 0; // PC = 0
    cpu.SetCpsr(0x00000030); // Thumb mode

    // Execute!
    cpu.Run();

    // Here we would expect cpu.Regs()[0] == 8
    printf("R0: %u\n", cpu.Regs()[0]);

    return 0;
}
```

Alternatives to Dynarmic
------------------------

Here are some projects with the same goals as dynarmic:

* [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) - Recompiling multi-architecture CPU emulator, based on QEMU
* [SkyEye](http://skyeye.sourceforge.net) - Cached interpreter for ARM

More general alternatives:

* [tARMac](https://davidsharp.com/tarmac/) - Tarmac's use of armlets was initial inspiration for us to use an intermediate representation
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) - Recompiling multi-architecture system emulator
* [VisUAL](https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html) - Visual ARM UAL emulator intended for education
* A wide variety of other recompilers, interpreters and emulators can be found embedded in other projects, here are some we would recommend looking at:
  * [firebird's recompiler](https://github.com/nspire-emus/firebird) - Takes more of a call-threaded approach to recompilation
  * [higan's arm7tdmi emulator](https://github.com/higan-emu/higan/tree/master/higan/component/processor/arm7tdmi) - Very clean code-style
  * [arm-js by ozaki-r](https://github.com/ozaki-r/arm-js) - Emulates ARMv7A and some peripherals of Versatile Express, in the browser

Disadvantages of Dynarmic
-------------------------

In the pursuit of speed, some behavior not commonly depended upon is elided. Therefore this emulator does not match spec.
Please note that this would mean that a guest application can easily determine if it is being run under instrumentation.

Known examples:

* Only user-mode is emulated, there is no emulation of any other privilege levels.
* FPSR state is approximate.
* Misaligned loads/stores are not appropriately trapped in certain cases.
* Exclusive monitor behavior may not match any known physical processor.

No formal verification has been done, and no security assessment has been made.
Use this code base at your own risk.
